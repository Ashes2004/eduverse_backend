1. **Identify Priority Topics:**
   - Based on the student's class and subjects, identify key topics or chapters that are essential for mastering the subject or preparing for exams.
   - Consider the student's institution rank to assess the competitive level and suggest advanced or foundational topics accordingly.

2. **Develop a Personalized Routine:**
   - Create a daily study routine tailored to the student's requirements.
   - Allocate specific time slots for each subject and topic, ensuring a balanced and efficient learning schedule.
   - Include time for revision, practice, and mock tests.

3. **Include Study Strategies:**
   - Provide study techniques for specific subjects (e.g., problem-solving practice for Math, summarization for History, or diagram-based learning for Biology).
   - Suggest strategies for weak areas and recommend how to improve them.

4. **Suggest Resources and Tools:**
   - Recommend books, online platforms, videos, or tools that can help the student understand the topics better.
   - Provide links or names of resources for self-paced learning.

5. **Incorporate Breaks and Health Tips:**
   - Emphasize the importance of taking short breaks between study sessions.
   - Encourage physical activity or relaxation techniques to improve focus and mental well-being.

6. **Motivational Advice:**
   - End with an encouraging message that inspires the student to stay committed to their plan and strive for success.
